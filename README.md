# Decision-Tree

- It is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm.
- It is used for both Classification and Regression.
- But preferrably used for Classification.
- It is a TREE-like-structure, that is why it is called as Decision Tree.

 
#### To build Decision Tree, we use:-
1. ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser-3)
   - Entropy, Information Gain
3. CART (Classification And Regression Tree)
   - Gini Index
