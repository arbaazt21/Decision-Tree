# Decision-Tree

- It is a Supervied Machine Learning Algorithm.
- It is used for both Classification and Regression.
- It is a TREE like structure, thatis why it is called as Decision Tree.
- But preferrably used for classification.

 
#### To build Decision Tree, we use two different algorithms.
1. ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser-3)
   - Entropy, Information Gain
3. CART (Classification And Regression Tree)
   - Gini Index
